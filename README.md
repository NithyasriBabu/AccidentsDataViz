# BeSafe

Theres been so many times on the freeway, that I have thought to go slowly because of witnessing accidents in the same spot multiple times. 

With the help of State-Wise Accidents Data and Weather Data from an open source API that could provide realtime weather information for a day, this appication aims to identify the spots in the vicinity of a given location that could potentially be a bad route to take for a specific weather.
